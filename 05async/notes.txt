Js -> Synchronous, Single-threaded
Each line wait for previous line to execute
Blocking Code->Synchronous vs. Non-Blocking Code->Asynchronous

File system
Reading a file -> Program passes the context to kernel , it performs reading the file
and then pass the context back to program to excute further.

Js engine -> Callstack + Memory heap.

Async js is available through browser apis like setTimeout clearTimeout etc.
