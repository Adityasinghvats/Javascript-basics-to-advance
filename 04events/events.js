// All events in js run sequentially except some e.g async
// Events invoke on some physical activity like mouse
// Event listener = Broadcast receiver
// Events to study:
// type, timestamp, defaultPrevented, target, toElement, currentTarget, clientPosition
// tilt, altkey, ctrlkey
// Event bubbling -> on setting up multiple event listener , the smallest unit will 
// alert first , then it will expand like bubble to outer element in html
// Capturing mode -> outer to inner
